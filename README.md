# 🧠 Blind Tracer

**Blind Tracer** is a grid-based memory and pathfinding game being developed with [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/). You’re shown a randomly generated maze for a brief moment—then the lights go out. Can you remember the correct path, avoid hidden obstacles, and collect rewards while navigating in the dark?

## 🕹️ Gameplay Concept

1. **Preview Phase**: Players are shown a randomly generated maze with walls, obstacles, and rewards for a limited time.
2. **Dark Phase**: The maze goes completely dark. Players must navigate based on memory alone.
3. **Obstacles**: Hidden traps will challenge the player’s memory and spatial awareness.
4. **Rewards**: Strategic placement of collectibles offers bonus points and incentives.
5. **Objective**: Reach the exit safely and efficiently—before time or lives run out.
